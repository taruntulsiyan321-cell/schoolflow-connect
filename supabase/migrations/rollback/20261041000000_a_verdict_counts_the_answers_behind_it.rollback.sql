-- ROLLBACK 20261041000000 — restores rpc_student_practice_analytics to the
-- shape that returned `attempts` and `skipped` but neither `answered` nor
-- `timed`.
--
-- READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING IT. The forward migration exists because a client
-- that receives only `attempts` gates its verdicts on the wrong denominator,
-- and the measured consequence was "Circles · Needs attention · 8 Attempts ·
-- 0% Accuracy" for a chapter with seven skips and one wrong answer. Rolling
-- back re-creates that hazard for any client that still reads `answered`:
-- those fields become undefined, every floor fails closed, and the Analysis
-- page reports "not enough yet" everywhere rather than reporting wrongly.
--
-- Roll the client back with it.
